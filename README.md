# Internationalizing Flutter apps

## Setting up an internationÂ­alized app: the Flutter_localizations package

- To use flutter_localizations, add the package as a dependency to your pubspec.yaml file, as well as the intl package:

flutter pub add flutter_localizations --sdk=flutter
flutter pub add intl:any

- This creates a pubspec.yml file with the following entries:

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_localizations:
    sdk: flutter
  intl: any

- Then import the flutter_localizations library and specify localizationsDelegates and supportedLocales for your MaterialApp or CupertinoApp:

import 'package:flutter_localizations/flutter_localizations.dart';

return const MaterialApp(
  title: 'Localizations Sample App',
  localizationsDelegates: [
    GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
    GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
    GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
  ],
  supportedLocales: [
    Locale('en'), // English
    Locale('ru'), // Russian
  ],
  home: MyHomePage(),
);

## Adding your own localized messages

- Open the pubspec.yaml file and enable the generate flag. This flag is found in the flutter section in the pubspec file.

flutter:
  generate: true

- Add a new yaml file to the root directory of the Flutter project. Name this file l10n.yaml and include following content:

arb-dir: lib/src/core/localization/translations
template-arb-file: intl_en.arb
output-localization-file: app_localizations.dart
